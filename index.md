# The Truth Matters ðŸ’¡
The truth is only as relevant as it can be proven. Data as a systemisation of
truth can be used to achieve parity, prosperity, and justice. It is my passion
- and life's mission to build data systems + data platforms to protect, secure,
and deliver "the truth."

# I am an autodidact ðŸŽ‰
This means I am self taught. It also means that I approach technical problems
in a unique way. This makes me fun to work with!
